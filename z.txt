to do
- leaderboard command
- keeping streaks of people typing gm
- if i turn off the bot then turn it back on, it loses track of who is on a cooldown (need a database of last successful invocation)

//

- you can keep spamming 'gm' to increase your tally. has to be a way of doing it once per day
    - cooldown, use buckettype user
    - if bot resets it doesn't really work, need a database, store last successful invocation

- how can we manage 'streaks' of people typing gm?
    - UserId | last_used | curr_streak
    - replit databse is only key/value store. no schemas. might be impossible to do this unless i move it off replit

a key : value store where it'll be

UserId | count of the number of times they've said it

^ need to add the cooldown then as well, bucket type user

^ doesn't work on bot resets. you'd normally store last successful invocation but i guess we'll have to take shortcuts since replit has its limitations

//

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print('bot has been activated')

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author.bot:
        return

    user = str(message.author.id)
    content = message.content.lower()

    if content == 'gm':
        update_db(user)

    await message.channel.send(f'your gm count is {db[user]}')

//

- closing the tab closes bot. replit can continue to run a WEB SERVER if the tab is closed though. a web server runs for 1 hr without any use (so keep poking it)

//

notes for scheduler and cooldown utils:
    - use a thread to run this so it doesn't block the main one, t = Thread(target=watcher), pass function don't call it - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42499299/python-threading-multiple-while-true-loops (DON'T USE WATCHER() LOL)
    
    - import schedule, import time

    - def job(): print("I'm working...")

    - schedule.every(10).minutes.do(job)
    - schedule.every().hour.do(job)
    - schedule.every().day.at("10:30").do(job)
    - schedule.every().monday.do(job)
    - schedule.every().wednesday.at("13:15").do(job)
    - schedule.every().minute.at(":17").do(job)

    - while True: schedule.run_pending()
