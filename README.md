# gm.bot
good morning discord bot hosted on repl.it

//

when you run the bot in repl.it, it turns off when you close the browser

however, web servers running on repl.it will continue to run for 1 hour even after you close the browser

we can spin up a web server and constantly ping it with uptimerobot, keeping the web server (and bot) up forever
